# Nine-Holes-Tic-Tac-Toe-

I did this because I wanted to challenge myself with styling and DOM manipulation. Basically, take something already challenging at my level, and put a nice shine on it. I think I met that goal. Also, 

Technologies used: HTML 5, CSS, JS ES6 (Vanilla-style, extreme DOM Manipulation, and my first go at keyframes animation, and totally rocked it). And one pixel art background from Canvas, but nothing else Canvas.

I didn't run into too many problems that I couldn't solve within a day; however, one was how to create an array of images. Instead of using X's and O's, I wanted to keep with the theme and add animated pixeled character art, preferably with transparent backgrounds. In the end I couldn't solve this quickly enough and settled. I plan to add that little wrinkle when I have more time to further enhace the game experience.
